    "# TME9 - The Amplitude Damping (AD) code\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous TME, we saw different kind of error channels that can affect qubits. One of the most common error channel is the amplitude damping (AD) channel, which models energy dissipation from a quantum system to its environment. This type of error is particularly relevant in systems where qubits can lose energy over time, such as in superconducting qubits or trapped ions. It can also be the loss of photon, pure loss or fiber attenuation in optical quantum communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum error correction codes are designed to protect quantum information from various types of errors, including amplitude damping. The AD code is a specific quantum error-correcting code that is tailored to correct errors caused by the amplitude damping channel. These errors will be described using a Pauli $(I, X, Y, Z)$ basis."

    "The amplitude damping (AD) channel represents a type of error that causes a qubit to lose energy, typically transitioning from the excited state $|1\\rangle$ to the ground state $|0\\rangle$. This type of error is particularly challenging to correct because it is not simply a bit-flip or phase-flip error; instead, it involves a loss of information about the qubit's state. Amplitude damping is not a unitary error, meaning it cannot be reversed by a simple unitary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying question is not why 4 qubits are needed specifically, but rather how many orthogonal subspaces must the code be able to distinguish in order to correct for the possible errors introduced by the amplitude damping channel. The action of AD on each qubit must land in distinct subspaces that can be identified and corrected:\n",

    "\n",
    "So we need at least 1 codespace of dimension 2 (to encode the logical qubit). But why at least 4 error spaces of dimension 2?\n",
    "Each qubit can either remain unaffected or undergo an amplitude damping error. For a 4-qubit code, there are 4 possible single-qubit amplitude damping errors (one for each qubit). Each of these errors maps the logical states into distinct orthogonal subspaces. Thus, to correct for all possible single-qubit amplitude damping errors, we need to be able to distinguish between the codespace and these 4 error spaces. Each error space must also be able to accommodate the two orthogonal states resulting from the amplitude damping of the logical qubit states.\n",

What condition must then be satisfied to be able to correct for AD errors?\n",

In other words, dimension counting says “maybe”, but the *structure* of $\\sigma^-_j$ says “no”.\n",

    " * For $n=4$, if you plug in your known 4-qubit codewords ($|0_L\\rangle,|1_L\\rangle$), the objective drops to (numerically) $\\sim$0 for the single-jump error model.\n",
