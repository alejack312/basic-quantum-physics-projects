    "\n",
    "In this TME, you will practice applying the concepts of **projective measurements, observables, and generalized measurements (POVMs)** as introduced in **Lecture 3**.\n",
    "You will work through a single semi-open problem composed of several logical steps.\n",
    "This notebook is meant to consolidate your understanding of **measurement theory** in quantum mechanics and its representation in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT REMARK ON SUBMISSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous TME, you will submit your jupyter notebook directly on the Moodle platform as a **PDF**. Keep the same format as last time with the only difference being you are now submitting the notebook `ipynb` as a **PDF** file instead of a `.py` file. Make sure the output of each cell is visible in the PDF. You may work in group but each student must submit their own PDF file with a unique number."
